## **User Stories**

### **First-Time Visitor Goals**

1. I want to find out what type of food I can expect from this restaurant.
    - The homepage has an 'About Us' section, which tells the user that food offered is fresh, healthy and delicious.
    - The 'Menu' page lists all of the food and drinks offered by the restaurant. It also tells the user whether each meal/drink is suitable for vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free diets.

2. I want to find out about the restaurant’s theme and atmosphere.
    - The theme is clearly conveyed to the user, with natural colours and images of natural foods and environments.
    - The theme is also conveyed in the welcome section of the homepage, which states, "...walk through our door and you'll be transported to a beautiful rainforest."

3. I want to know the location and opening times of the restaurant.
    - The 'Find Us' page contains a map, which pinpoints the location of the restaurant. When clicked on, the map links to the interactive Google Maps, so the user can get a clearer idea of where the restaurant is and how to get there.
    - The address, phone number and email address of the restaurant is clearly displayed next to the map, marked clearly with icons.
    - The restaurant's opening times are listed beneath the contact details section, well-spaced and easy to read.

4. I want to see if I like anything on the menu and if vegetarian options are available.
    - The 'Menu' page shows all of the food and drinks offered. Beneath the title of each menu item is a space dedicated for logos. The logos, 'V', 'VG' and 'GF' have a title denoting their meaning, which shows when the cursor hovers over them.

5. I want to find what I’m looking for quickly, without having to read too much or follow too many links.
    - There are a small number of navbar items, each of which have value to the user.
    - There is a limited amount of white space, meaning less scrolling, particularly on smaller screens.
    - The 'Menu' page has an additional navbar for each menu course category, enabling the user to navigate quickly to their desired section without having to scroll down.
    - The 'Menu' page also features a 'back to top' button, which reduces the need for excessive scrolling. 

### **Returning Visitor Goals**

1. I want to see if there are any special offers.
    - While there are no special offers displayed on the website, the user is able to see the price of all items on the menu.

2. I want to see if I can book a table at my preferred location.
    - The 'Book Now' page contains a form, which allows the user to submit a booking request. The form only requires necessary information and is relatively short, which means the user doesn't have to apply too much effort when submitting their request.

## **Frequent Visitor Goals**

1. I want to see if there is a loyalty scheme and subscribe to the newsletter for special offers and discounts.
    - While there is no loyalty scheme or subscription at the moment, this feature could be added in the future.

3. I want to visit the restaurant’s social media profiles to find new offers.
    - The footer bar at the bottom of each page contains links to several social media websites. The logos are clearly displayed, equally sized and easy to interact with.

4. I want to know if there are new additions to the menu.
    - The 'Menu' page shows all items available on the menu. Although there are no sign-posted new additions, they would be visible on the menu.

5. I want to know if I can buy any of the restaurant’s products to cook at home.
    - While the restaurant's website does not offer this feature at the moment, this feature could be implemented in future if Rainforest Cafe had their own brand ingredients or special offerings.
