## **User Stories**

### **First-Time Visitor Goals**

1. I want to find out what type of food I can expect from this restaurant.
    - The homepage has an 'About Us' section, which tells the user that food offered is fresh, healthy and delicious.
    - The 'Menu' page lists all of the food and drinks offered by the restaurant. It also tells the user whether each meal/drink is suitable for vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free diets.

2. I want to find out about the restaurant’s theme and atmosphere.
    - The theme is clearly conveyed to the user, with natural colours and images of natural foods and environments.
    - The theme is also conveyed in the welcome section of the homepage, which states, "...walk through our door and you'll be transported to a beautiful rainforest."

3. I want to know the location and opening times of the restaurant.
    - The 'Find Us' page contains a map, which pinpoints the location of the restaurant. When clicked on, the map links to the interactive Google Maps, so the user can get a clearer idea of where the restaurant is and how to get there.
    - The address, phone number and email address of the restaurant is clearly displayed next to the map, marked clearly with icons.
    - The restaurant's opening times are listed beneath the contact details section, well-spaced and easy to read.

4. I want to see if I like anything on the menu and if vegetarian options are available.
    - The 'Menu' page shows all of the food and drinks offered. Beneath the title of each menu item is a space dedicated for logos. The logos, 'V', 'VG' and 'GF' have a title denoting their meaning, which shows when the cursor hovers over them.

5. I want to find what I’m looking for quickly, without having to read too much or follow too many links.
    - There are a small number of navbar items, each of which have value to the user.
    - There is a limited amount of white space, meaning less scrolling, particularly on smaller screens.
    - The 'Menu' page has an additional navbar for each menu course category, enabling the user to navigate quickly to their desired section without having to scroll down.
    - The 'Menu' page also features a 'back to top' button, which reduces the need for excessive scrolling. 

### **Returning Visitor Goals**

1. I want to see if there are any special offers.
    - While there are no special offers displayed on the website, the user is able to see the price of all items on the menu.

2. I want to see if I can book a table at my preferred location.
    - The 'Book Now' page contains a form, which allows the user to submit a booking request. The form only requires necessary information and is relatively short, which means the user doesn't have to apply too much effort when submitting their request.

## **Frequent Visitor Goals**

1. I want to see if there is a loyalty scheme and subscribe to the newsletter for special offers and discounts.
    - While there is no loyalty scheme or subscription at the moment, this feature could be added in the future.

3. I want to visit the restaurant’s social media profiles to find new offers.
    - The footer bar at the bottom of each page contains links to several social media websites. The logos are clearly displayed, equally sized and easy to interact with.

4. I want to know if there are new additions to the menu.
    - The 'Menu' page shows all items available on the menu. Although there are no sign-posted new additions, they would be visible on the menu.

5. I want to know if I can buy any of the restaurant’s products to cook at home.
    - While the restaurant's website does not offer this feature at the moment, this feature could be implemented in future if Rainforest Cafe had their own brand ingredients or special offerings.

## **User Testing**

1. Peer reviews indicated issues with the performance of the homepage and menu page. This was primarily due to the size of the images. A peer recommended that I apply the loading="lazy" attribute to images to mitigate this issue. 
    - I took my peer's advice and applied the attribute, which appeared to improve the performance slightly. As I had already compressed the images, I decided to download smaller images to replace those across the website, which resolved this issue.
2. My husband recommended that I use more hover effects on buttons and links to make the website experience more authentic. 
    - I found that adding more effects improved User Experience and made the website appear more interactive.
3. My mentor found the white space across the website to be excessive at times, so suggested I reduced margins to improve User Experience. 
    - I accepted my mentor's recommendation and found that it gave the website a cleaner and more professional appearance.
4. My mentor noticed overflow in the 'About Us' section on the homepage. As I hadn't used a grid, the content was not well-contained on smaller screens. 
    - I re-wrote code for the section, and decided to re-write the code on the Menu page, to utilise the grid display.
5. Final tests showed that all links were working correctly, there were no apparent bugs, and the website was easy and enjoyable to use.
