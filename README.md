Introduction
Welcome to Rainforest Cafe’s website! Located in the heart of London’s Soho district, we’ve brought a little piece of the rainforest to one of the world’s busiest cities. Relax in our plant-filled cafe, or soak up the sun in our tropical garden. Feast on our naturally delicious treats and feel good for doing good, by dining with a sustainable and fairtrade business.
Rainforest Cafe is a fictional business, created by Alice Hillier for the first project in Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development programme.

In order to gauge what makes a successful restaurant website, I undertook online research to find common themes, features and layouts. 
Some of the restaurant websites I researched were:
Las Iguanas 
•	Offers Latin American cuisine
•	Horizontal navbar, with repeated links throughout the page
•	Vibrant background colours/links
•	Lots of images of colourful food and tropical locations/beaches
•	Large fonts
•	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, about, find us, deliveries, parties, shop
•	Subscription prompt at the bottom of the page
Nando’s
•	Offers barbecued chicken in a variety of sauces (some vegetarian options available)
•	Horizontal navbar, with repeat links throughout the page
•	Primarily white background with vibrant links and images of colourful food
•	Medium to large fonts
•	Features include – ‘order online’ button on top right corner, menu, loyalty scheme, restaurants, cook, about us, help, careers
•	Subscription prompt underneath header
