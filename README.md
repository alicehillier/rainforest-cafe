## Introduction
Welcome to Rainforest Cafe’s website! Located in the heart of London’s Soho district, we’ve brought a little piece of the rainforest to one of the world’s busiest cities. Relax in our plant-filled cafe, or soak up the sun in our tropical garden. Feast on our naturally delicious treats and feel good for doing good, by dining with a sustainable and fairtrade business.
Rainforest Cafe is a fictional business, created by Alice Hillier for the first project in Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development programme.

## Strategy Plane
In order to gauge what makes a successful restaurant website, I undertook online research to find common themes, features and layouts. 
Some of the restaurant websites I researched were:
Las Iguanas 
-	Offers Latin American cuisine
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeated links throughout the page
-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food and tropical locations/beaches
-	Large fonts
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, about, find us, deliveries, parties, shop
-	Subscription prompt at the bottom of the page
Nando’s
-	Offers barbecued chicken in a variety of sauces (some vegetarian options available)
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeat links throughout the page
-	Primarily white background with vibrant links and images of colourful food
-	Medium to large fonts
-	Features include – ‘order online’ button on top right corner, menu, loyalty scheme, restaurants, cook, about us, help, careers
-	Subscription prompt underneath header
Turtle Bay

As part of my research, I also conducted interviews to identify what a user wants or needs from a restaurant website.
