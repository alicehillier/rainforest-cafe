## Introduction

Welcome to Rainforest Cafe’s website! Located in the heart of London’s Soho district, we’ve brought a little piece of the rainforest to one of the world’s busiest cities. Relax in our plant-filled cafe, or soak up the sun in our tropical garden. Feast on our naturally delicious treats and feel good for doing good, by dining with a sustainable and fairtrade business.
Rainforest Cafe is a fictional business, created by Alice Hillier for the first project in Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development programme.

## Strategy Plane

In order to gauge what makes a successful restaurant website, I undertook online research to find common themes, features and layouts. 
Some of the restaurant websites I researched were:

### Las Iguanas 

-	Offers Latin American cuisine
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeated links throughout the page
-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food and tropical locations/beaches
-	Large fonts
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, about, find us, deliveries, parties, shop
-	Subscription prompt at the bottom of the page

### Nando’s

-	Offers barbecued chicken in a variety of sauces (some vegetarian options available)
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeat links throughout the page
-	Primarily white background with vibrant links and images of colourful food
-	Medium to large fonts

-	Subscription prompt underneath header

### Turtle Bay

-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food, cocktails and tropical locations
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, locations, bottomless, happy hour, delivery, community
As part of my research, I also conducted interviews to identify what a user wants or needs from a restaurant website.

## Scope Plane

Based on the research conducted in the Strategy Plane, I decided to include the following features in Rainforest Cafe’s website:
-	‘Book Now’ button and Book Now page
-	Find Us page with opening times and contact information
-	Menu page
-	About Us section on the landing page
-	Social media links at the bottom of each page as well as conventional footer links
-   Form acceptance page and error page to deliver a more authentic experience.

I made the following design choices based on research of competitors’ websites: 
-	Use vibrant colours to reflect the theme of the restaurant
-	Use plenty of images to show the restaurant’s products and atmosphere
I ensured that I met the following functionality requirements:
-	Users can navigate to the correct section quickly and easily
-	Use less text and more images to convey information to users
-	Users can use the website comfortably on different devices

## Structure Plane

The contents of the website were carefully considered and selected for their relevance and usefulness to users. 

I decided to include only a small number of links in the navbar to avoid confusing users. The links were those that I found most common on other restaurant websites and, just as importantly, related to several of the points mentioned in the user stories.

I also chose to separate the website into pages, so users wouldn't have to scroll endlessly to find the desired information. As the website features the restaurant's comprehensive menu, I felt that this feature in particular would cause frustration if it were to be implemented in a single-page website.

## Skeleton Plane

When starting to design my website, I created detailed wireframes using Balsamiq. I considered how the website would appear on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, and prepared a set of wireframes which would show how the website would look as users scrolled through each page.

## Surface Plane

After establishing the content of the website, I began putting together the aesthetics. 

### Colour Scheme

Given the name of the restaurant, Rainforest Cafe, I wanted to use natural colours to convey the theme. I used Color Hunt to find a suitable palette.

https://colorhunt.co/palette/f2e3db41644a263a29e86a33

The main colour used is the darker shade of green, #263A29, which I applied to the navbar in the header, and the social media links bar in the footer. The colour is also used for the text on a white background.

The orange colour, E86A33, is used on the menu page. I alternated use of this colour and a lighter shade of green, 519259, taken from this palette:

https://colorhunt.co/palette/064635519259f0bb62f4eea9

I opted for this lighter shade as found the other green colour on the first palette to be a little dark.

### Typography

I employed a consistent font across my website, which was sourced from Google Fonts. 

K2D is a sans-serif font, ensuring that it is readable and comfortable to look at. 

### Imagery

When selecting images for my website, I wanted to make sure that they were colourful, informative, and reflected the restaurant's theme. All images were sourced from Pexels and Unsplash.

#### Homepage

The hero image on the homepage is the user's first look at what the restaurant has to offer. The image conveys the theme of the restaurant well, showing greenery, colourful healthy food and a sophisticated set up styled with natural materials.

The About Us section, which is made up of four columns, gives the user a clear idea of what is special about the restaurant. 

The first column, 'Our Food', shows a selection of fresh and colourful fruits. This suggests to the user that the food offered is natural and healthy.

The second column, 'Our Environment', shows an outdoor dining setting. With plenty of greenery, wooden beams, warm lighting and elegant dining furniture, the user is intended to feel as though they are in a garden, a world away from city life.

The third column, 'Our Partners', shows fresh fruit growing on a tree. This, again, suggests to the user that the ingredients used by the restaurant are fresh and natural. 

The fourth and final column, 'Our Planet', depicts two howler monkeys sitting in a tree. This suggests to the user that the restaurant is related to, and cares about, the natural world. This is an encouraging message as it reassures potential diners that the restaurant is not only good for them, but for the environment too.

The section link images towards the bottom of the page reflect their respective links and are consistent with the details of the restaurant's location and products. The dark filter applied to the images ensures that the text is legible and eye-catching. 

#### Menu

The menu page has many images, showing the user what food is served at the restaurant. The images are colourful and show fresh, healthy and natural food. The user is able to see if the food served appeals to them and what quality they should expect.

#### Find Us

The map displayed on this page was found on Google Maps. I took a snippet of the image so that users would be able to locate the restaurant more easily.

#### Book Now

The background image, which extends across the full height and width of the page, shows plenty of greenery in an indoor setting. This, again, conveys the natural theme and aesthetic of the restaurant.

## Features

### Homepage

#### Navbar

The navbar is fixed to the top of the screen and extends across the entire width of the page. On smaller devices, the navbar doubles in length in order to allow ample space between links. This limits the opportunity for accidentally pressing links. The name of the page currently being viewed is underlined, so users won't become lost.

The navbar consists of these 5 links:

1. Restaurant Name - Links to homepage

2. Home - Links to homepage

3. Menu - Links to a page consisting of the restaurant's entire menu, structured in clear sections with meal descriptions and prices.

4. Find Us - Links to a page consisting of a clickable map, which takes the user to the exact location on Google Maps,the restaurant's address, telephone number and email address. 

5. Book Now - Links to a form page, which asks for relevant details regarding users' booking. The submit button at the bottom of the form is centered and easy to identify.  

I chose to include only a small number of links that would have value for users and prevent them from spending too much time trying to locate the desired information.

#### Hero Image and Welcome Section

Beneath the navbar, users see the large hero image, followed by a short welcome section. The welcome section consists of the restaurant's name and a brief description of it's theme.

#### About Us

Scrolling down, users see a four-column grid with the headings 'Our Food', 'Our Environment', 'Our Partners' and 'Our Planet'. Underneath each heading, an image covers the width of the column, with a short description relating to each heading underneath.

#### Section Links

Towards the bottom of the page, three large images stretch across the screen, with h2 text centered in each with flex. The entire image, as well as the text, links to its named page.

#### Footer

Sitting at the bottom of the page, a bar of green, matching the navbar, stretches across the entire width of the page. Social media links, identifiable by their logos, are spaced evenly in the center. 

Beneath the social media links is a conventional footer list, separated into three columns. The links, which currently lead to an error page, are well-spaced to ensure that they can easily be read and interacted with.

### Menu

The main content of the menu page is made up of 4 containers, with 8 cards in each. The first card in each container displays an h2, which indicates what type of content the user should expect to see in that section. The sections are well-defined, using alternating colours to indicate to the user when they are looking at a different section.

Sitting on top of the first container is a small navbar for the menu, so the user can easily navigate to a specific section if they desire. When each link is hovered over, an underline appears, so the user can see that they can click on the link and visit that specific section.

In each food/drink item card of each container, the user can see an image of the food/drink, its name, logos denoting if it is suitable for vegan, vegetarian or gluten-free diets, a short description of the meal, and its price. All content is centered in the card and has ample spacing for easy reading.

### Find Us

This page is split into two columns. The first column features a map, which, when clicked on, takes the user to the precise location on the interactive Google Maps. The top part of the second column lists the address of the restaurant, its phone number and email address. The bottom part of the second column displays the opening times of the restaurant. The columns are aligned and evenly spaced.

### Book Now

The booking page features a white booking form, with a plant-filled background to make it more visually appealing. 

The booking form asks for relevant information from the user and requires select options, date input, a textarea and text inputs. All input fields are required and have the appropriate input type applied. The form is well-spaced and places the labels alongside their respective inputs. This reduces excessive length of the form and allows the user to review the information they input.

The large 'BOOK NOW' button at the bottom of the form is centered and has inverted colours to capture the user's attention. When clicked, the 'BOOK NOW' submit button takes the user to a page which thanks them and outlines the next steps.

### Error Page

This page is concise and offers a more authentic experience to the user. To avoid having non-working links, the error page accepts the user's actions and responds to them. If the user were to click on a link which does not respond, it may appear to be a bug or lead the user to believe that something has gone wrong.

### Thank You Page

Similar to the Error Page, this page is concise and offers a more authentic experience. It exists as a means to reassure the user that their form has been submitted and received. The user is informed of the next steps, which eliminates any concerns of their booking being lost or not received.
