## Introduction
Welcome to Rainforest Cafe’s website! Located in the heart of London’s Soho district, we’ve brought a little piece of the rainforest to one of the world’s busiest cities. Relax in our plant-filled cafe, or soak up the sun in our tropical garden. Feast on our naturally delicious treats and feel good for doing good, by dining with a sustainable and fairtrade business.
Rainforest Cafe is a fictional business, created by Alice Hillier for the first project in Code Institute’s Diploma in Software Development programme.

## Strategy Plane
In order to gauge what makes a successful restaurant website, I undertook online research to find common themes, features and layouts. 
Some of the restaurant websites I researched were:
### Las Iguanas 
-	Offers Latin American cuisine
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeated links throughout the page
-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food and tropical locations/beaches
-	Large fonts
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, about, find us, deliveries, parties, shop
-	Subscription prompt at the bottom of the page
### Nando’s
-	Offers barbecued chicken in a variety of sauces (some vegetarian options available)
-	Horizontal navbar, with repeat links throughout the page
-	Primarily white background with vibrant links and images of colourful food
-	Medium to large fonts
-	Features include – ‘order online’ button on top right corner, menu, loyalty scheme, restaurants, cook, about us, help, careers
-	Subscription prompt underneath header
### Turtle Bay
-	Offers Caribbean cuisine

-	Vibrant background colours/links
-	Lots of images of colourful food, cocktails and tropical locations
-	Features include – ‘book now’ button on top right corner, menu, locations, bottomless, happy hour, delivery, community
As part of my research, I also conducted interviews to identify what a user wants or needs from a restaurant website.

## Scope Plane
Based on the research conducted in the Strategy Plane, I decided to include the following features in Rainforest Cafe’s website:
-	‘Book Now’ button and Book Now page
-	Find Us page with opening times and contact information
-	Menu page
-	About Us section on the landing page
-	Social media links at the bottom of each page as well as conventional footer links
-   Form acceptance page and error page to deliver a more authentic experience.

I made the following design choices based on research of competitors’ websites: 
-	Use vibrant colours to reflect the theme of the restaurant
-	Use plenty of images to show the restaurant’s products and atmosphere
I ensured that I met the following functionality requirements:
-	Users can navigate to the correct section quickly and easily
-	Use less text and more images to convey information to users
-	Users can use the website comfortably on different devices

## Structure Plane
The contents of the website were carefully considered and selected for their relevance and usefulness to users. 

I decided to include only a small number of links in the navbar to avoid confusing users. The links were those that I found most common on other restaurant websites and, just as importantly, related to several of the points mentioned in the user stories.

I also chose to separate the website into pages, so users wouldn't have to scroll endlessly to find the desired information. As the website features the restaurant's comprehensive menu, I felt that this feature in particular would cause frustration if it were to be implemented in a single-page website.

## Skeleton Plane
When starting to design my website, I created detailed wireframes using Balsamiq. I considered how the website would appear on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, and prepared a set of wireframes which would show how the website would look as users scrolled through each page.

## Surface Plane
After establishing the content of the website, I began putting together the aesthetics. 

### Colour Scheme

Given the name of the restaurant, Rainforest Cafe, I wanted to use natural colours to convey the theme. I used Color Hunt to find a suitable palette.

The main colour used is the darker shade of green, #263A29, which I applied to the navbar in the header, and the social media links bar in the footer. The colour is also used for the text on a white background.

The orange colour, E86A33, is used on the menu page. I alternated use of this colour and a lighter shade of green, 519259, taken from this palette:

I opted for this lighter shade as found the other green colour on the first palette to be a little dark.

### Typography

I employed a consistent font across my website, which was sourced from Google Fonts. 

K2D is a sans-serif font, ensuring that it is readable and comfortable to look at. 


## Features
### Navbar
The navbar consists of these 5 items:
1. Restaurant Name - Links to homepage
2. Home - Links to homepage
3. Menu - Links to a page consisting of the restaurant's entire menu, structured in clear sections with meal descriptions and prices.
4. Find Us - Links to a page consisting of a clickable map, which takes the user to the exact location on Google Maps,the restaurant's address, telephone number and email address.  
5. Book Now - Links to a form page, which asks for relevant details regarding users' booking. The submit button at the bottom of the form is centered and easy to identify.
